PARALLEL TESTING

Why do we use parallel testing?
- To save time.

1 test 1 min 1 machine = 1 min


How did you implement PARALLEL TESTING  in your project?
-WE ADD "MAVEN SUREFIRE PLUGIN" WITH ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATIONS THAT ENABLES PARALLEL TESTING.

What problem we need to solve after adding plugin?
-Driver utility, singleton design pattern.

How do we change our Driver to handle multi-threads?
#1 Driver.getDriver() method name stays same.
#2- We wrap out "driver" instance with InheritableThreadLocal
#3 Now tht we are using "InheritableThreadLocal", we adjust out code in .getDriver() method to use methods coming
from "InheritableThreadLocal"

Instead of using "driver" we use driverPool.get()

INTERVIEW QUESTION
If you used Singleton in your Driver, how did you handle parallel execution?
#1 I wrapped my WebDriver object with ThreadLocal that's creates a copy of driver object per thread.
#2 Instead of using driver directly I used driverPool.get() method to get a driver instance from a pool of drivers objects

QUESTIONS:

What is a framework?
-Frameworks are basically commonly used, and proven approach of creating file and folders structure,
creating smart logic to be able to easily handle and maintain our project

Why do we create a framework?
-Frameworks are easy to use and understand

How is BDD similar to TDD?
-Instead of writing test, we write SCENARIOS
-We implement the logic that turns those scanrios into actions usin Java + selenium + junit

What are the 2 difference sides of BDD?
1-Business Layer: Feature files
2-Implementation Layer : step definitions

What is a snippet?
-Unimplemented step def methods that are automatically generated by Cucumber

Different ways of generating snippets]
1- Run the RunnerClass and generate the snippet console
2- Hover over the unimplemented step --> create step def --> select class where we want it
3- Put your cursor on the unimplemented line
ALT+Enter --> create step def --> select class where we want it

How to create a feature file and implement scenario STEP BY STEP
Create a feature file under feature directory
Use feature keyword to provide information about the feature that will be tested
Use scenario to describe the scenario
Add Steps (Given When Then And But)
Generate our snippets to implement "Step_definitions"
6Copy paste the snippet into the step_def .java class we have
Implement out JAVA+SELENIUM+JUNIT logic to urn the step into an actual action
