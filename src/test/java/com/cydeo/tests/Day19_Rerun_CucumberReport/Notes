What is the difference between Data Table and Scenario Outline?

- Data tables allows us to pass collection type into step in a feature file
- Scenario outline is completely different. It is similar approach to Parameterization.
But instead of passing the test data inside the step, we provide a test data as a table
under our Scenario Outline/Template
- We can not create Scenario Outline/Template without providing a "Examples:" table
- But we can use "data tables" without having to use "Examples:"
- Scenario Outline and Scenario Template are SAME thing. Just an alternative keyword.

RERUN:

- Cucumber Rerun is plugin coming from Cucumber
- This plugin allows us to keep track of FAILED scenarios
- All we have to do is use the plugin, and provide where it should be creating the .txt file

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW TO IMPLEMENT RERUN PLUGIN:

#1. syntax: add appropriate plugin under "plugins" in our CukesRunner
class
plugin = {
        "html:target/cucumber-report.html",
        "rerun:target/rerun.txt"
},
"rerun:target/rerun.txt":
- rerun --> plugin name
- target/ --> where we want to store rerun.txt file
- rerun.txt --> file name and file type. I can pass any file name here


#2. CREATE A NEW RUNNER CLASS WHICH WILL BE FAILEDTESTRUNNER

- This runner class will be pointing directly tot he rerun.txt file that is generated by out plugin.
- It only have 1 job
- When we run it, it will execute the "failed" scenarios that are stored in the rerun.txt file

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(
        features = "@target/rerun.txt",
        glue = "com/cydeo/step_definitions"
)
public class FailedTestRunner {
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do we need RERUN and FailedTestRunner?

- Mostly to save time when tests fails.
- If we have hundreds of tests, and only few of them are failing, we don't want to execute all of the
hundreds of the tests again.
- That's why we can just execute the failed tests that are automatically stored under the rerun.txt using our
FailedTestRunner.

- FailedTestRunner cannot change or edit the rerun.txt.
- Therefore even if the tests are passing, the lines will still in the
rerun.txt, which is normal.
- We can delete rerun.txt by going Maven --> clean

#1- close project intellij and open again
#2- reload the project
#3- file > invalidate cache
file > restart intellij
#4- go to ~/.m2 file > go in the repository > select all folder > delete
then maven --> reload
