TESTNG:

What is TestNG?
-It is UNIT TESTING FRAMEWORK

Is this tool created for testers?
-No, its mainly for developers.

Is this only for Unit testing framework?
-No, there is also JUNIT NUNIT

How do we create structure or change the behaviors of method using TestNG
-ANNOTATIONS

Using annotations we can change the behavior of the methods.

Common annotations we will be using?
-@Test
-@BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod ---
-@BeforeClass, @AfterClass
-@BeforeTest, @AfterTest
-@BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite

@Test:
-This annotation will convert a regular java method into a runnable test method.
-Each test run by default in Alphabetical order
-We can change the running order, using priority
-Each test is independent from each other UNLESS we create dependency

Ex:
@Test
public void test1(priority = 1){
code
assertion
}

@Test
public void myTest2(priority = 2, dependsOnMethod="test1"){
}

@BeforeMethod:
- It will run once before each test.
- The number of test we have, will be determining the number of this method will be running
- If we have 10 @Test, this will run 10 times before each test

@AfterMethod:
- Same as @BeforeMethod, but it will run after @Test
- It will just run once after each @Test

@BeforeClass:
- It will ONLY RUN 1 TIME in each class before everything else
- This doesn't care about how many @Test you have

@AfterClass:
- It will ONLY RUN 1 TIME in each class after everything else
- This doesn't care about how many @Test you have

EX: If we want to open a browser before each @Test and close after each @Test, where do we put our setUp and tearDown methods?
1. @BeforeMethod: WebDriver driver =
WebDriverFactory.getDriver("chrome")
2. @AfterMethod: driver.quit() or driver.close()

Assertions:
What do assertions do?
-Assertions are used to verify actual=expected
-Type of assertions can be String, int, List<String>,
-Assertions determine if a test pass or fail

There are 3 types of Assertions:
-Assert.assertEquals(actual,expected,"Optional fail message")
-Assert.assertTrue(actual.equals(expected),"Optional fail message")
-Assert.fail() --> used for developers to make test fail purposely

DROPDOWNS:
How many types of dropdowns we have?
- 2 types: (HTML dropdown, Select dropdown)

#1 HTML dropdown:
-if thr dropdown has no ,select. tag, it is a html dropdown
-we handle like other WebElements: locate it and click on it

#2 Select dropdown:
-If the dropdown has <select> tag it is select dropdown
-to be able to handle this type of dropdown we have to use SELECT class

SYNTAX: Select select = new select(finding <select> dropdown WebElement)

getOptions():
-it will get all options from this HTML
-Return type: List<WebElement>

getFirstSelectedOptions();
-it will give us default option or current selected option
-Return type: WebElement

How can we do selections on select dropdown?
There are 3 ways:
-selectByVisibleText
-selectByValue
-selectByIndex
