Selenium Automation Notes 1

Software helps to love problems

Our motto: Copy past, make it work. Less effort - more money!

Work smart, not hard!

Automation Framework will consist of bunch of things. (Java Selenium WebDriver IntelliJ Cucumber bDD JUnit Maven)

The client: he tells the taxi driver where he wants to go and how to get there.
Taxi driver: he executes the clients request, the taxi sends his own request to the car.
The Car: the car executes the taxi drivers request.

How selenium webdriver works?

The client gets to the destination through dialogues that happen between the client - taxi driver and taxi driver  - car.

Test engineer: that writes the automation code; the automation code sends request to the browser driver component
The browser driver component: it executes the test engineer requests; it sends its own request to the browser
The browser: it executes the browser driver requests
===============================================================================================

Maven ProjectL
-Maven is a "build" automation tool
-"build" : repeating steps when we are creating a project
-Maven project itself is different than java project
-Maven is not a tool for testers only it is mainly tool for developers
-It comes with certain ype of folder structure and other files

-SRC
-main: this is for developers. they write their own code
-test: this is where developers write their unit test. As a tester we will just need this test folder

-pom.xml : this file is used to add and manage dependencies of out project
-target L this folder is where maven project is storing the compiled version of the project and some other information
-it will only appear after you run your code

=============================================
Selenium Navigation
back - takes to previous page
forward - takes us to forwarded page
refresh - refreshes the page

=======================================================
1- What does this method do?
2- Does it accept any arguments
3- Does it have any return type
4- Does it throw any certain type of exception

- get("");
#1- What does this method do?
-It gets given URL in opened browser

#2- Does it accept any arguments
-yes it accepts a string arg

#3- Does it have any return type
-Void return type

Basic Navigation :
driver.navigate() --> navigate methods allows us to do simple navigations
driver.navigate().forward() --> will take page to forward page
driver.navigate().back() --> will take page to previous page
driver.navigate().refresh() --> will refresh the current page
driver.navigate().to --> same as .get("") method

- .getTitle();
#1. What does this method do?
-It gets the title of the page

#2. Does it accept any argument
No it doesn't accept any arg

#3 Does it have any return type?
Yes, it returns a String

- .getCurrentUrl():
#1 What does this method do?
-Gets current URL of the current page

#2. Does it accept any argument
No, it doesn't accept any arg

#3 Does it have any return type?
Yes, it returns a String

- driver.manage().window().maximize();
maximize the currently opened browser
This maximizing will happened on the line of code we call this method

- driver.manage().window().fullscreen();
It is also maximizing the page
This method is not working for some type of windows version

-Why maximizing the page is important?
Because in different sizes the content displayed will be different
This happens if the page is "responsive"
Responsive: if size gets small, it will display less content
-maybe it will store some web elements under some hamburger menu, or some other type of menu

- driver.close();
Will close only the currently opened browser/page
If we have more than one window opened, it will only close the one that focused on

- driver.quit();
It will kill the current session.
If we have more than 1 window open, it will close all of them.
After using quit() method, we can not execute any more line of code
It will give exception (NoSuchSessionException)
